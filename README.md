The city of New York is planning to roll out sign-up sites for digital contact tracing. They have specified that they would like resources to be allocated to communities with clear need of contact tracing, and which show promise in reaching the most vulnerable citizens. 
We have decided that the best way to make suggestions would be based on the numbers of people passing through MTA stations as high subway use may result in higher transmission rates. We can then suggest locations in close proximity to those stations. Using subway traffic data to inform locations ought to weight the test sample towards essential workers, lower-income, and minority communities which have been shown to be hardest-hit in the pandemic, and who are already more likely to utilize public transportation. Using COVID-19 infection data, we plan to identify sites with proximity to communities with high rates of infection and high MTA turnstile-flow.
